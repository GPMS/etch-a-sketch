# Etch-a-Sketch

This is my implementation of the [Etch-a-Sketch Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)
from the JavaScript section of the Foundations course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

In this project we try to simulate a canvas with divs and allow the user to draw there using the provided tools.
